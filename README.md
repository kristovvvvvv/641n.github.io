#  Basic writing and format syntax
### Create sophisticated formatting for your prose and code on GitHub with simple syntax.
Kristov Hernandez 9-Gonzalez


## 1. Adding images to your website
You can display an image by adding ! and wrapping the alt text in [ ]. Alt text is a short text equivalent of the information in the image. Then, wrap the link for the image in parentheses ()


> [!NOTE]
> Be mindful about your capitalizations

## 2. Attaching files
You can convey information by attaching a variety of file types to your issues and pull requests.

>NOTE
>For public repositories, uploaded files can be accessed without authentication. In the case of private and internal repositories, only people with access to the repository can view the uploaded files.


To attach a file to an issue or pull request conversation, drag and drop it into the comment box. Alternatively, you can click  in the formatting bar above the comment box to browse, select, and add a file from your computer.
